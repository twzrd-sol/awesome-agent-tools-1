## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a system that uses an LLM as its core reasoning engine and can:

- **Reason** about problems and plan solutions
- **Act** by calling tools, APIs, or executing code
- **Observe** the results of its actions
- **Iterate** until the task is complete

This distinguishes agents from simple chatbots or single-turn LLM applications.
